### ModBus Library

* Modbas is one of the safest and most popular industrial protocols. This protocol has two modes of slave and master. In Modbas, access to memory cells is possible through the address of the registry

* Master: In this mode, the other slaves are summoned and sent orders. The summoned slave reacts to the command when it receives it, thus forming a connection between several devices. Slaves each have a parameter to identify called a slaveID.
